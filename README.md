## Oden Technologies < https://oden.io/> 
## Overview and Origin
### **The Company – Oden Technologies, Inc.** 
#### The company was founded in 2014 by Willem Sundblad and Peter Brand
#### It was incorporated in London, UK on September 10, 2014
#### Willem Sundblad serves as CEO and Co-Founder Peter Brand as Chief Commercial Officer  
#### In 2014, the founders saw the necessity for manufacturers to get the right information served to the right people at the right time in order to win.
#### Industries around the world were using their own data to improve their business, and manufacturing was being left behind. 
#### The idea was to build a solution that enabled those closest to production, the operators, to use the data in an actionable and useful way.
#### The company started as hardware and software IOT company.  
#### Today, Oden’s products serve the entire manufacturing analytics need, from guided analytics to advanced AI capabilities.

### **Funding**
#### The company is a start-up, funded by private equity funds and venture capital.  
#### Total capital raised to date **$58.7M** 
#### Initial seed funding of **$5.9M** was raised in March 2017.
#### Early investors include Atomico, Localglobe, INBOXCAPITAL and EQT Venture.
#### Recently raised $28.5M in Series B funding in April 2024.
#### **Series B** funding was led by Nordstjernan Growth Fund, Sweeden and included other new investors Flat Capital, Inx International Ink Co, and Recurring Capital Partners. 
#### New funds are slated to be used 
##### *to scale the product*
##### *invest in data enrichment and domain knowledge*, and 
##### *to expand market presence*, according to the company’s press release.

### **Business**
#### Leading provider of AI-powered analytics for **manufacturing**.
#### Includes process AI with focus on machine learning to optimize manufacturing processes and improve efficiency.
#### The strategy is narrowly focused on a subset of manufacturing industry, particularly companies with *continuous* or *batch-continuous* processes.  
#### Key industries of target include operator-dependent segments such as paper and pulp, plastics, and metals.  
#### Target companies of mid- to large-size  <with revenue between $1B to $10B>.
#### Hardware is not a core competency anymore.  Rather, they rely on partners to provide the hardware.
#### Operates in three business segments *Process AI*, *Factory Analytics*, and *Data Engine*

### **Business Segments**
#### Process AI
##### **Process AI** is Oden’s premier software offering.
##### Prescriptive process recommendations delivered to machine operators that adjust to real-time line constraints and organizational goals. 
##### Process AI to empower new operators to perform like experienced team members.
##### Turns inexperienced operators into high performers in one click. 
##### Ensures front-line workers have the exact information they need — when they need it— to achieve peak production.
#### Factory Analytics
##### Out-of-the-box and configurable analytics and visualizations 
##### Uncovers opportunities and root causes of efficiency loss. 
##### Serves the various groups surrounding the operator to gain insight about their processes.
#### Data Engine 
##### Making the messiest of manufacturing data usable. 
##### Aggregates, cleans, and enriches 5+ million data points per line per day, all in real-time.
##### Data Engine can be used as an operational data warehouse within an unified namespace architecture, saving countless hours of IT and data analyst time.

### **Solution to Today’s Problem**
#### The manufacturing sector has largely been left behind in the AI revolution.
#### A large set of data is generated, but not compiled and analyzed systematically.
#### Oden’s solutions empower manufacturers to take a data-driven approach to production improvements. 
#### Manufacturers are aware that quality is an increasingly significant problem. 
#### 56% percent of manufacturers say that improving quality and/or reducing scrap is a top challenge, a concern tied to reducing unplanned downtime.
#### Getting to the root causes of quality failures can be very difficult. 
#### If data is not unified, timely, or correctly analyzed, then the causes of problems can go undetected or unaddressed for a long time. 
#### **The solution is guided analytics.** Guided analytics allow engineers to make process improvements ten times faster than with traditional monitoring systems, and provide intelligence that helps improve efficiency, maximize output quality, and minimize downtime.
#### Company’s AI-powered software transforms the most chaotic of manufacturing data into *useful*, *impactful*, and *actionable* recommendations, predictions, and data-driven targets.
#### The company’s AI solutions combine best-in-class data aggregation and organization to deliver prescriptive analytics and automation, helping manufacturers optimize production for throughput, quality, profitability and sustainability. 

### **Competitors in the AI in manufacturing space**
	#### Most of the competitors in this space are start-ups.
	#### Close approximation derives the following two companies as competitors
##### **Instrumental** 	https://instrumental.com/
Instrumental provides expertise in hardware, software, and artificial intelligence to deliver the Manufacturing Optimization Platform.  However, the company is primarily focused on the electronics industry, with both co-founders’ experience at <Apple>.  The traditional manufacturing segment is not targeted.
##### Synergies Intelligent Systems	https://www.synergies.ai/   
Synergies Intelligent Systems. was founded in Boston by Dr. Chang Tsung Yao in 2016. It focuses on developing the JarviX no-code data analysis full-process platform, which features augmented analytics technology. Allows general personnel with the ability to perform no-code analysis and development. 
### **Strategic Advantages over Competition**
#### No close competitor in the traditional industrial space
#### Customized AI models based on products and targets
#### Focused on manufacturing industries.  Whereas, many of the competitors are in electronics and pharmaceutical industries.

## # **Technology and Business Approach**
#### Boots on the ground involvement in the design and implementation process with the clients
#### The company’s software uses guided analytics.
 
### **Core Metrics**

#### Return on Investment in Technology

### **Business Impact and Customer Testimonials**
#### For *INX Ink International*, a high-performance ink and coatings producer, Oden’s software is helping improve product quality and consistency across batches while maximizing throughput. Per INX, the technology increased the asset availability in the first three months by 13%, increase in line speed by 40%, and reduction in changeover time by 71%3.
#### Lake Cable, an electrical and electronics cable manufacturer in Chicago, has been an early participant in Oden’s technology.  Since its implementation, Lake has seen an 8% increase in monthly capacity, 25% increase in first-pass yield and 30% increase in process engineer productivity.

### **Summary**
#### Manufacturing industries have been slow to adapt AI in day-to-day operations.  
#### Part of the reason is also neglect by AI developers and technology companies.
#### This gap was recognized by Oden Technologies.
#### The company is making significant headway into this space.
